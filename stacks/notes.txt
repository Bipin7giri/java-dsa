Stacks in Java for DSA Practice
Stacks are fundamental data structures with various applications in computer science. In Java, you can work with stacks using the built-in Stack class or implement your own. Here's how you can explore stacks for DSA practice in Java:

Understanding the Basics:

LIFO (Last In, First Out): Elements are added (pushed) and removed (popped) from the top. Think of it like a pile of plates where you add new ones on top and remove the most recent one first.
Operations: The main operations are push(), pop(), peek(), isEmpty(), and size().
Practice Implementation:

Built-in Stack class: Import the java.util.Stack class and use its methods for basic operations. This is a good starting point, but it might not offer advanced features.
Custom implementation: Create your own stack using an array or linked list. This allows you to understand the underlying mechanisms and tailor it to your specific needs.

PUSH
step1: if Top = MAX - 1
print "overflow"
GOTOP step 4
step2: set top = top +1
step3: set Stack[TOP] = Elements
step-4:END

pop
step1: if Top = NULL
PRINT "stack is isEmpty"
GOTO step3
step2: return Stack[TOP]
step:3: END
